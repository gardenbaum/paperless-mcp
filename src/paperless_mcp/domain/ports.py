"""The ports: what services need from Paperless, split by resource into readers and writers.

Every Paperless port lives here. The adapter (``paperless_mcp.paperless``) and the test fake
implement them; the contract suite (tests/contract) needs a contract test per method and checks
that the fake guards every method of a ``*Writer`` port.
